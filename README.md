# Crochet_Pattern_CounterðŸ§¶
The easy way to keep track of your rows and rounds during your latest crochet project!<br>

When I crochet, I work from free patterns online. While I can print out the pattern, I hate to mark or cross out the steps in the pattern because I might use the pattern again in the future. But without marking steps off, it is difficult to keep track of where you are, especially in patters with rounds in the 40s and higher!ðŸ˜µ<br>

This counter project is one solution to this issue. With this counter, users will be able to view their pattern rounds/rows on screen and simply tap to move to the next. First, I considered doing a basic checklist style in which you could see the full list of rounds/rows, mark the check boxes, and have the step fade or strikethrough. However, it can be difficult to tap an exact spot on a screen when your hands are holding yarn and a needle. It would be easier to have a broader area or tap, or even swipe.ðŸ™Œ<br>

In my final design, three pattern rounds/rows will be displayed as cards, with the center card being the current round/row and visibly larger. The left card will be the previous round/row and the right card will be the next round/row. Using larger cards will also allow an image to be displayed with the round/row if needed.<br>

I will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this project. The default pattern will be for a beginner level drink coaster.ðŸ§¶<br>

ðŸ”®A future feature will be the ability for users to upload the rows/rounds of their own patterns into the program.
